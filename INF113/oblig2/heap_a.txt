# Task 2a
First when we use our malloc we get the address 0x7ffff7c88010,
and when we check the pmap on our pid we see the val with 1MB
it will show the address 00007ffff7c88000. 16 bytes difference 
as mentioned.

The 16-byte offset between the address returned by malloc and 
the start of the heap region in pmap contains metadata used by 
malloc to track allocation size and status of the memory block.

When we look at them, we will see:
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 10 10 00 00 00 00 00

We can se that this in little endian 0x00101002 will be around 1MB.
This value will also have a alignment of 16.
We requested 1024 * 1024 which is roughly 1.048MB, and we we got
1.052MB, this could be alignment padding, where it rounds up on the
last page (which is around 4kB as roughly is the difference).
