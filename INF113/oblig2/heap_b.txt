# Task 2b
Yes, we can confirm that a page is 4KB, as shown on the pmap-writeout,
where each memory region is in 4KB multiples

When malloc reservs memory, one page of 4KB is immediately sent to 
RSS to set up metadata and structures for the virtual memory.

In my case 12KB immediately allocated in RSS.
