# Task 2c

I have around 2 GB of memory on this VM and when using free -h,
i see that i have 1.9 GiB, where only 85 MiB is free. When running
an iterative funcitin which increase 1 MiB at a time i reach
1968 MiB before malloc returns NULL.

When making repeated malloc calls with a large fixed size, the
amount of memory allocated is limited by the systems virtual
memory. 

Without writing to memory, we only reserve virtual space. 
When doing this on my 64 bit system, i allocated 27476GiB.
This is roughly the same as 2^44 which makes sense as i am
using a 64-bit system.

When writing to each allocated block, memory is commited, and
the program will crash earlier due to physical memory or swap
space limits, resulting in segmentation fault.
