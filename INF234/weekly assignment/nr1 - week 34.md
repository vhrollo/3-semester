-  This statement is false, and an valid counterexample showing this is a set of two men and two women.
	- m prefers w over w'
	- m' prefers w' over w
	- w prefers m' over m
	- w' prefers m over m'

- Given that man m and woman w who rank each other as their top choice the G-S, the woman w that m is going to propose to first will be the highest ranked one, and if woman w is paired with man m', then she will compare m' to m. Every m' will be switched out when compared to m, and therefore this statement is true. Every stable matching S will include (m, w).
