### How to blow up a pipeline
Oppsumering
5 - 20
- Historisk kontekst:
	- begins during the COP1 climate negotiations during 1995 
	- Since COP1 (1st Conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) the levels of fossil fuels has skyrocketed.
	- Legger trykk på at ikke-voldeilige protester har lite effekt
		- delegatene gikk bare ut bakdøren hvor protester skjedde utenfor COP1s front
		- det at jorden viser miljøskader viner ikke over kapital vin
	- London book review:
		- Climate activists think that terrorism to spread their cause is wrong
Definisjoner

Teori
- The "Lanchester's paradox" mentioned here is significant because it challenges the assumption that the most effective or desperate actions (like sabotage or terrorism) would naturally emerge in response to an existential threat like climate change. Malm uses this paradox to explore why these actions have not occurred and whether they might be necessary.
	- activists are perhaps reluctant to resort to violence or sabotage due to ethical concerns
- Cap-and-trade is a system that limits aggregate emissions from a group of emitters by setting a “cap” on maximum emissions
- Obama failed to get it through
- Along with the Keystone XL, the proposed pipeline for transporting oil form the candian tar sands to the refineries ringing the gulf coast
	- huge protest
	- ended up rejected by Obama, and then built by Trump
	- Same happened with Dakota Access Pipeline

 **First Cycle (2006-2009):**
- **Focus:** Northern Europe.
- **Key Actions:** Climate camps and direct actions against emissions sources like airports and coal plants.
- **Outcome:** Despite significant mobilization, this cycle ended in disappointment, particularly after the failure of COP15 in Copenhagen to secure binding emissions cuts.

 **2. Second Cycle (2011-2014):**
- **Focus:** United States.
- **Key Actions:** Campaigns against the Keystone XL pipeline and the divestment movement, with major events like the 2014 People’s Climate March in New York City.
- **Outcome:** Some successes, like Obama’s rejection of Keystone XL, but momentum was halted by Trump’s election and policy reversals.

**3. Third Cycle (2018-2019):**
- **Focus:** Global.
- **Key Actions:** School strikes led by Greta Thunberg (Fridays for Future) and Extinction Rebellion’s large-scale civil disobedience actions.
- **Outcome:** The largest mobilization yet, but structural changes remain elusive, raising questions about whether more radical tactics might be needed.

- Malm describes how the climate movement has remained committed to non-violence, avoiding physical force or property destruction even in the face of intense police aggression, as seen in a 2018 protest in Groningen, Netherlands.
- This restraint, while maintaining public sympathy and allowing mass participation, has also limited the movement's ability to escalate its tactics. The "action consensus" among activists strictly prohibits damaging infrastructure, even when faced with aggressive opposition.
- The non-violent approach has conferred tactical advantages, such as keeping the movement accessible and gaining public and media support. The movement’s peaceful nature has prevented it from being labeled as extremist or terrorist.
- However, Malm questions whether this strict non-violence will be sufficient to stop fossil fuel extraction and whether the movement should consider more aggressive tactics if peaceful methods fail.

- Continued investments in oil, hydro and coal even after the protests

- The IEA noted a "growing mismatch" between these investment trends and the goals of limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. This highlights a fundamental disconnect between the capitalist economy, which continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, and the urgent need to transition to renewable energy to prevent climate catastrophe.

- A 2019 study published in _Nature_ highlights the rapid and unprecedented expansion of long-lived fossil-fuel-based energy infrastructure in recent decades. Despite global climate goals, the fossil fuel industry has continued to grow, with nearly half of all operating fossil fuel units having been commissioned after 2004.

- Long-Term Commitments: Fossil fuel investments are designed to operate for decades, making it economically difficult to dismantle them. These "committed emissions" lock in high levels of CO2 for the foreseeable future.

- State and Capital Collaboration: Fossil fuel industries are closely supported by states, making it hard for the climate movement to challenge or disrupt these entrenched systems.

- Studies show that the emissions from current and planned fossil fuel infrastructure will exceed the carbon budget necessary to keep global warming below 2°C, with coal infrastructure alone being enough to crash this limit.
	- source?

- Investment confidence
	- if an investment is made in fossil fuel, it wont pay off for a while, meaning the investor want this to stay like this 
	- and when money come, they want it to stay like this as long as possible
	- pipeline should stay intact for 40 years ish
	- committed emissions
		- infrastructure which investors want to keep running until its end
		- this will definitely drag us above 1.5, and with proposed plasns this will drag us above 2.0 
		- Incumbent coal infrastructure will drag us over

- the tension between climate action and pacifism
	- pacifism may sometimes fail to prevent suffering.
	- a pacifist who makes 

- McKibben
	- a leading climate activist who is the driving force behind a lot of campains
	- the idea of turning the other cheek, of taking on unearned suffering
		- bibal saying: respond to violence with non-violence and forgivenss rather than retaliation. symbolizes a broader approch of pacifism

- Moral and Strategic Pacifism
	- Moral pacifism is described as a commitment to enduring suffering without retaliation
		- Ghandi - salt march
	- Strategic pacifism, on the other hand, is considered as a calculated tactic that avoids violence because it is often counterproductive and detracts from the movement's goals.

- XR
	- non-violent, it is a practical strategy to achieve political change
	- Inspired by civil rights movements
	- use of strategic pacifism
	- effectiveness and moral clarity

- Ghandi
	- drove the british out of india, but also launced the attack on the legitamacy of colonialism around the world
- The end of apartheid in South Africa after Nelson Mandela's release.
- The revolt against Margaret Thatcher's poll tax in the UK, where ordinary citizens wrote letters, refused to pay, and even volunteered to go to jail.
- The fall of Slobodan Milošević in Serbia and the toppling of Hosni Mubarak during the Egyptian uprising.

- XR mentions this in one chapter
	- non-violence is the royal road to achiving political goals.

- Suffragettes movement
	- non-violent movement in uk which focused on womans rights.
	- militants tactics when peaceful actions failed to yield results
	- These were disruptions to force the goverment to act, epmhpasizing that a shift to more agressive methods was often necessary to bring real change

- This questions the absolute commitment to XR to stay 100% non-violent

Ghandi's philosophy of *Satyagraha* emphesizing non-cooperation, boycots, and civil disobedience. He urged Jews in Germany to practice non-violence, suggesting that voluntary suffering could be turn into spiritual act. 

For many in the Civil Rights Movement, non-violence was not just a moral stance but a strategic tactic—more effective than armed struggle in achieving their goals. The author suggests that successful resistance often requires a combination of both non-violent protest and readiness for self-defense, challenging the idea that non-violence is always sufficient by itself.

Martin Luther King Jr. threatened that violent forces would arrise if demands were not met.

Strategic pacifism should move onto violence when it no longer works

fossil fuel systems can be overthrown through stragegies similar to those used in pas liberation movements. 
- fossil fuel interest are deeply embedded in contemporary capitalism, and dismantling them requires far more then political change

civil resistance model was endores by movements like Extinction Rebellion
- chenoweth and stephan
- he critiques that non-violent is more likely too succeed than violent ones, as the ones who this is quoted from oversimplified all conflicts where she categorized them
- they are overlooking the complexities of certain conflicts 
- They do not acknowledge that in some struggles, like the resistance against isreali occupation by groups like hezmollah, armed or violent resistances played a significal role
- It is wrong to have these historically situations side by side with climate crisis, they are not the same class of problem and what they are against

Iran's 1979 used both violent and non-violent methods to achieve its goals.

He says that the autocracies cannot be dismantled through non-violence alone, as more intense and coordinated actions may be required

Egyptian Revolution of 2011 as an example where unarmed collective violence was a crucial role in removing the regime. Improvised weapons. Were not organized by military actions but spontaneous acts by ordinary people that disrupted civic order, creating an opportunity for regime change. The contrasts XR which will only use non-violence.

Selective historical lens used by strategic pacifists like Chenoweth and Stephan
- sanitizes history

The author contends that this selective retelling is of limited use for tackling the climate crisis, which requires a more comprehensive understanding of how change is achieved.

Understanding the dimension of the struggle. 

The temporal urgency is different than suffragettes. Dire and accelerating
