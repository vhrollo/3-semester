**Civil disobedience**
- Civil disobedience is form of protest against certain injustices within an established, largely just democratic regime. It's meant to address situations where serious violations of justice occur, even though the overall system is largely fair. The author emphasizes that this theory is specific to democratic societies and doesn't extend to all forms of dissent of authoritarian contexts.

- **Separation from Other Forms of Opposition**: Civil disobedience is distinguished from other forms of opposition, such as militant action or organized resistance. It ranges from legal demonstrations to actions meant to bring test cases before the courts.
- **Conditions of Justification**: The theory defines the circumstances under which civil disobedience is justified, focusing on a just or nearly just democratic system.
- **Role within the Constitution**: Finally, the theory aims to explain how civil disobedience fits within the constitutional system, assessing whether it is an appropriate and effective form of protest in a free society.

- If such a theory makes our reflections clearer and helps us align our judgments more coherently, then it is valuable. The theory's purpose is to reduce the gap between the personal convictions of those who believe in democratic principles and the complex realities they face when deciding whether to engage in civil disobedience.

**Definition of Civil Disobedience**
- "public, nonviolent, conscietious yet polictical act contraary to law usually done with the aim of brining about a change in the law or policies of the goverment. By acting in this way one addresses the sense of justice of the majority of the community and declares that in oneâ€™s considered opinion the principles of social cooperation among free and equal men are not being respected." - 320
	- they are prepared to oppose the statute even if it should be upheld
	- To be sure, in a constitutional regime, the courts may finally side with the dissenters and declare the law or policy objected to unconstitutional.
- The political act should only be addressed to the majority of the society, and based on political principles, particularly the principles of justice that shape the constitution and social institutions
	- does not appeal to personal morality or personal doctrines
- The passage assumes that in a reasonably just democratic regime, there exists a shared public understanding of justice that guides how citizens interpret and engage with the constitution and their political obligations.
- The act has to be done in public, addressed to public principles
- nonviolent
- appeal to to the conscience of the public and those in power.
	- if this doesn't work, they may include warnings and strong admonitions
		- martin Luther king jr.

- We must pay a certain price to convince others that our actions have, in our carefully considered view, a sufficient moral basis in the political convictions of the community
	- this is so that people will 
- Falling in between legal protest, and conscientious refusal. Form of dissent at the boundary of fidelity to law
- militant is somebody who is more engaging in civil disobedience
	- involves disruptions
	- rejecting the legitimacy of the legal order
	- reforms must be radical to address injustices
- The limited scope of civil disobedience
	- operates within the system

**Definition of conscientious refusal** 
- Conscientious refusal is defined as noncompliance with direct order or administrative mandate due to moral or ethical reasons. Unlike civil disobedience, which is often more public and aimed at appealing to a broader sense of justice, conscientious refusal may not involve any intent to communicate or make a public statement. It is simply a refusal to comply based on personal convictions
	- a pacifist refusal to serve in armed forces

- Covert or overt. If overt it may be classified as a conscientious evasion. For instance, covert resistance to fugitive slave law falls under conscientious evasion.

- Contrast to civil disobedience
	- public appeal, doesn't have to be public
	- motivation, 
		- it merely focuses on disobeying an unjust command, compared to SD which is intended to bring social or political change
	- can be based on personal or religious convictions
- The refusal may be political or nonpolitical. It is political if it involves rejecting a law or a requirement on the basis of a disagreement with the political principles behind it.

**Justification of Civil Disobedience**
- John Rawl focuses on internal, non-international injustices 

- Types of wrong appropriate for civil disobedience
	- addressed of justice of the community

- fundamental principles
	- the principle of justice
	- principle of equal liberty
	- principle of fair equality of opportunity

- Challenges in identifying violations
	- not always easy to determine whether these principles are being violated
	- sometimes when complexities, it is difficult to check the influence of self-interest and prejudice 

- examples
	- minorities denied the right to vote
	- repression of certain religious groups

- justifiable only if normal, legal means of appealing to political majority have been attempted and have failed
- when legal protests and demonstrations have also failed. When legal means prove ineffective, civil disobedience becomes a **last resort**.


- There are extreme situations where civil disobedience might be justified **without first exhausting legal means**
	- blatant unjust law
	- f.ex banning a minority religion

 - In extreme situations, civil disobedience may be necessary without going through prolonged legal channels, especially if the injustice is egregious and the authorities are shown to be acting with **hostile intent**.

- Using the two previous conditions as the criteria of relevantly similar circumstances, we can say that, other things equal, two minorities are similarly justified in resorting to civil disobedience if they have suffered for the same length of time from the same degree of injustice and if their equally sincere and normal political appeals have likewise been to no avail.

summarized:
- nature of injustice
- exhaustion of normal appeals
- limitation due to potential consequences


- Coordination is needed between minority to regulate the level of dissent. This helps ensuring civil disobedience remain effective without overwhelming the political system

- The civil disobedience should be regulated to prevent chaos and maintain the efficiency of the constitution. 

- These conditions are not exhaustive; some allowance still has to be made for the possibility of injury to third parties, to the innocent, so to speak.

- The natural duty of justice supports a **constitutional regime** that ensures fair participation for all citizens.
- Although dissenters may not have the same political obligations, they still have **obligations to those they work with to pursue common goals**.
