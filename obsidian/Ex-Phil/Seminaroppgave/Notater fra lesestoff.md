### How to blow up a pipeline
Oppsumering
5 - 20
- Historisk kontekst:
	- begins during the COP1 climate negotiations during 1995 
	- Since COP1 (1st Conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) the levels of fossil fuels has skyrocketed.
	- Legger trykk på at ikke-voldeilige protester har lite effekt
		- delegatene gikk bare ut bakdøren hvor protester skjedde utenfor COP1s front
		- det at jorden viser miljøskader viner ikke over kapital vin
	- London book review:
		- Climate activists think that terrorism to spread their cause is wrong
Definisjoner

Teori
- The "Lanchester's paradox" mentioned here is significant because it challenges the assumption that the most effective or desperate actions (like sabotage or terrorism) would naturally emerge in response to an existential threat like climate change. Malm uses this paradox to explore why these actions have not occurred and whether they might be necessary.
	- activists are perhaps reluctant to resort to violence or sabotage due to ethical concerns
- Cap-and-trade is a system that limits aggregate emissions from a group of emitters by setting a “cap” on maximum emissions
- Obama failed to get it through
- Along with the Keystone XL, the proposed pipeline for transporting oil form the candian tar sands to the refineries ringing the gulf coast
	- huge protest
	- ended up rejected by Obama, and then built by Trump
	- Same happened with Dakota Access Pipeline

 **First Cycle (2006-2009):**
- **Focus:** Northern Europe.
- **Key Actions:** Climate camps and direct actions against emissions sources like airports and coal plants.
- **Outcome:** Despite significant mobilization, this cycle ended in disappointment, particularly after the failure of COP15 in Copenhagen to secure binding emissions cuts.

 **2. Second Cycle (2011-2014):**
- **Focus:** United States.
- **Key Actions:** Campaigns against the Keystone XL pipeline and the divestment movement, with major events like the 2014 People’s Climate March in New York City.
- **Outcome:** Some successes, like Obama’s rejection of Keystone XL, but momentum was halted by Trump’s election and policy reversals.

**3. Third Cycle (2018-2019):**
- **Focus:** Global.
- **Key Actions:** School strikes led by Greta Thunberg (Fridays for Future) and Extinction Rebellion’s large-scale civil disobedience actions.
- **Outcome:** The largest mobilization yet, but structural changes remain elusive, raising questions about whether more radical tactics might be needed.

- Ende Gelande meaning here an no further
- Winning a gas pipe there, and a coal plant scrapped there

- Malm describes how the climate movement has remained committed to non-violence, avoiding physical force or property destruction even in the face of intense police aggression, as seen in a 2018 protest in Groningen, Netherlands.
- This restraint, while maintaining public sympathy and allowing mass participation, has also limited the movement's ability to escalate its tactics. The "action consensus" among activists strictly prohibits damaging infrastructure, even when faced with aggressive opposition.
- The non-violent approach has conferred tactical advantages, such as keeping the movement accessible and gaining public and media support. The movement’s peaceful nature has prevented it from being labeled as extremist or terrorist.
- However, Malm questions whether this strict non-violence will be sufficient to stop fossil fuel extraction and whether the movement should consider more aggressive tactics if peaceful methods fail.

- Continued investments in oil, hydro and coal even after the protests

- The IEA noted a "growing mismatch" between these investment trends and the goals of limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. This highlights a fundamental disconnect between the capitalist economy, which continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels, and the urgent need to transition to renewable energy to prevent climate catastrophe.

- A 2019 study published in _Nature_ highlights the rapid and unprecedented expansion of long-lived fossil-fuel-based energy infrastructure in recent decades. Despite global climate goals, the fossil fuel industry has continued to grow, with nearly half of all operating fossil fuel units having been commissioned after 2004.

- Long-Term Commitments: Fossil fuel investments are designed to operate for decades, making it economically difficult to dismantle them. These "committed emissions" lock in high levels of CO2 for the foreseeable future.

- State and Capital Collaboration: Fossil fuel industries are closely supported by states, making it hard for the climate movement to challenge or disrupt these entrenched systems.

- Studies show that the emissions from current and planned fossil fuel infrastructure will exceed the carbon budget necessary to keep global warming below 2°C, with coal infrastructure alone being enough to crash this limit.
