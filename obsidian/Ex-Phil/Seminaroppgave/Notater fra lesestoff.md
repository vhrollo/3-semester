Oppsumering
5 - 20
- Historisk kontekst:
	- begins during the COP1 climate negotiations during 1995 
	- Since COP1 (1st Conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) the levels of fossil fuels has skyrocketed.
	- Legger trykk på at ikke-voldeilige protester har lite effekt
		- delegatene gikk bare ut bakdøren hvor protester skjedde utenfor COP1s front
		- det at jorden viser miljøskader viner ikke over kapital vin
	- London book review:
		- Climate activists think that terrorism to spread their cause is wrong
Definisjoner

Teori
- The "Lanchester's paradox" mentioned here is significant because it challenges the assumption that the most effective or desperate actions (like sabotage or terrorism) would naturally emerge in response to an existential threat like climate change. Malm uses this paradox to explore why these actions have not occurred and whether they might be necessary.
	- activists are perhaps reluctant to resort to violence or sabotage due to ethical concerns
- Cap-and-trade is a system that limits aggregate emissions from a group of emitters by setting a “cap” on maximum emissions
- Obama failed to get it through
- Along with the Keystone XL, the proposed pipeline for transporting oil form the candian tar sands to the refineries ringing the gulf coast
	- huge protest
	- ended up rejected by Obama, and then built by Trump
	- Same happened with Dakota Access Pipeline

 **First Cycle (2006-2009):**
- **Focus:** Northern Europe.
- **Key Actions:** Climate camps and direct actions against emissions sources like airports and coal plants.
- **Outcome:** Despite significant mobilization, this cycle ended in disappointment, particularly after the failure of COP15 in Copenhagen to secure binding emissions cuts.

 **2. Second Cycle (2011-2014):**
- **Focus:** United States.
- **Key Actions:** Campaigns against the Keystone XL pipeline and the divestment movement, with major events like the 2014 People’s Climate March in New York City.
- **Outcome:** Some successes, like Obama’s rejection of Keystone XL, but momentum was halted by Trump’s election and policy reversals.

**3. Third Cycle (2018-2019):**
- **Focus:** Global.
- **Key Actions:** School strikes led by Greta Thunberg (Fridays for Future) and Extinction Rebellion’s large-scale civil disobedience actions.
- **Outcome:** The largest mobilization yet, but structural changes remain elusive, raising questions about whether more radical tactics might be needed.
