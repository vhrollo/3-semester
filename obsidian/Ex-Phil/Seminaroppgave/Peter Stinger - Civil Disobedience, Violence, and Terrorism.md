### Civil Disobedience, Violence and Terrorism

**Gennarelli's experiments**
- Animal Liberation Front broke into their headquarters to get video tapes of illegal monkey experiments in 1984. This was done after going through appropriate channels, and then they were ordered to stop
- 1986 Joan Andrews Christian woman brakes abortion equipment
- Tasmanian hydro dam, 1982
- 2500 activists in us, shut down the capitol power plant for a few hours as a response to how the us government responded to the climate change.

**Individual Conscience and the law**
- individuals have a responsibility to act according to their conscience rather than blindly follow the law. - Henry Thoreau
- We should do as our conscience dictates, as we autonomously decide we ought to do, no as the law directs
- unreflective obedience to an "internal voice" is inadequate for ethical decisions. Instead, decisions should be based on critical ethical reasoning, considering the consequences of actions.

**Law and Order**
- It begins by acknowledging that while laws can have moral weight, they do not automatically determine what is ethical
- The main question raised is whether breaking a law that upholds a morally wrong practice can itself be ethical.
- Without established laws, society could descend into chaos, as attempts to self-regulate through vigilantism would likely lead to violence and gang warfare.
	- hobbs
- "settled, known law", john locke
- law enforcement is a communal burden, and lawbreaking imposes costs on society
- In cases where the outcome of disobedience (such as preventing environmental damage) is significant enough, it may justify the risk of weakening respect for the law.

**Democracy**
- legal avenues can fail to produce progress or can be too slow and painful
	- drives people to civil disobedience
- The text cites the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion as an example where legal reform came after long and often violent protest, highlighting how civil disobedience can sometimes precede or spur change.
- Democracy can't always reflect the majority opinion when the opinion is morally wrong
	- thats when civil disobedence come in

**Disobedience, civil or otherwise**

The text outlines two key reasons why illegal actions might be justified: 
- when the legal system fails to represent minority views effectively
- when the issue at stake is so serious that it justifies breaking the law.
- In these cases, the use of illegal actions may become necessary when legal channels for reform are blocked or too slow to produce change.

**Violence and Terrorism**

- Pacifist view: it is always wrong, regardless of its consequences to use violence
- consequentialism: it is justified to use violence if the consequences turns out good. Mill and Buntham

- Indiscriminate violence, particularly violence that targets innocent civilians or bystanders (as in terrorist acts), is never justifiable.

Property damage vs. harm to sentient beings
- While destroying property (e.g., damaging laboratories where animals are tested) might be less severe than harming individuals, it still requires justification.

Justifying violence
- Violence is rarely justifiable because it often leads to further harm, retaliation, or the failure to achieve the desired goals.

- Targeted violence, trying to assassinate a tyrant
- indiscriminate violence, terrorism

Complexity of the issue
- Each case must be judged based on its particular circumstances, the intent behind the violence, and the outcomes it is likely to produce. While some forms of violence might be justifiable in extreme cases (e.g., ending widespread oppression or genocide), these are rare exceptions.
- absolute condemnation of violence is common
	- but recognize their consequences first, before condemning
