# What is a operative system:
The OS presents a virtual representation of the hardware to the programs
- CPU
- RAM
- Memory

It allows for multiple programs to run "at the same time".
It shares access to its RAM and Memory
It shares access to I/O
It also needs to be secure, f.ex one process should not disturb another running "at the same time"

**Example**: the program should not care what kind of memory is connected to the machine

# Components to a operative system

### The kernel
- The kernel is one of the first programs that should run when the machine loads, and is always in the background, where it has the responsibility for the resource management
- 

### The API-application programming interface
*systemcalls - syscalls*

- C-functions which programs can use to ask the kernel to do a task

### BIOS
- BIOS stands for "Basic Input/Output System", in old machines, the firmware was known as the BIOS, but more modern systems use UEFI (The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) now, which is faster and more general and makes better use of facilities in contemporary processors.

### Drivers
*drivers is a part program inn the OS which runs and interacts with a specific hardware*

### command line - cli
*in Linux, it uses bash*

- Programs which understand the command line are called "shell"
- direct and flexible Interaction with the OS


### Operating System Shell 
- The shell is the outermost layer of the operating system. Shells incorporate a programming language to control processes and files, as well as to start and control other programs. The shell manages the interaction between you and the operating system by prompting you for input, interpreting that input for the operating system, and then handling any resulting output from the operating system.
