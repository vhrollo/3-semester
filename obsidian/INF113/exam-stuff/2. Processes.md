# Von Neumann architecture 

### ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit
- A Bus
- B Bus
- ALU control lines (use control number n)
- C Bus (output)

### Memory
- Addresses
- each address contain a byte
- probably some that support bit-level addressing

## Registers
*memory on the CPU*
- For most modern CPUs, registers are either 32-bit (4 bytes) or 64-bit (8 bytes). These bit widths align with common CPU architectures (32-bit or 64-bit).
- Some specialized registers may have different sizes. For instance, x86 CPUs have some 128-bit, 256-bit, or even 512-bit registers used for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations.

## Instruction Cycle

1. **FETCH** – load the instruction that the IC points to, increment the IC
2. **DECODE** – interpret the instruction, calculate addresses needed by the instruction
3. **EXECUTE** – execute the instruction, for example:
   - $move$
   - $add$
   - $compare$
   - $jump$ (modifies the IC)
4. **WRITE BACK** – store the result in registers

### Instruction counter - IC
The **Instruction Counter (IC)** is a special register within the CPU that keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be executed. Here’s how it works in the instruction cycle:

1. **FETCH**: The IC points to the memory address of the current instruction that needs to be fetched. During this phase, the CPU retrieves the instruction from memory.
2. **INCREMENT**: After fetching, the IC is usually incremented to point to the next instruction in sequence. This increment can vary depending on the instruction length or if a jump (branch) instruction alters the control flow.
3. **JUMP/BRANCH**: If a jump, call, or branch instruction is executed, the IC is updated with a new address, making the program execution jump to a different part of the code.

Essentially, the **IC** or **Program Counter** is like a bookmark in your program, keeping track of where the CPU is in the instruction sequence. It’s critical for sequential program execution, as it ensures that instructions are processed in the correct order unless explicitly modified by control flow instructions (e.g., jumps, branches, or calls).

### OPCODES
*example of x86 opcodes*

| Opcode | Mnemonic | Operand 1 | Operand 2 | Description                |
| ------ | -------- | --------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| 0x00   | ADD      | r/m8      | r8        | Add                        |
| 0x01   | ADD      | r/m16/32  | r16/32    | Add                        |
| 0x02   | ADD      | r8        | r/m8      | Add                        |
| 0x03   | ADD      | r16/32    | r/m16/32  | Add                        |
| 0x04   | ADD      | AL        | imm8      | Add                        |
| 0x05   | ADD      | eAX       | imm16/32  | Add                        |
| 0x06   | PUSH     | ES        |           | Push ES segment onto stack |
| 0x07   | POP      | ES        |           | Pop value into ES segment  |
| 0x08   | OR       | r/m8      | r8        | Logical Inclusive OR       |
| 0x09   | OR       | r/m16/32  | r16/32    | Logical Inclusive OR       |
| 0x0A   | OR       | r8        | r/m8      | Logical Inclusive OR       |
| 0x0B   | OR       | r16/32    | r/m16/32  | Logical Inclusive OR       |
| 0x0C   | OR       | AL        | imm8      | Logical Inclusive OR       |
| 0x0D   | OR       | eAX       | imm16/32  | Logical Inclusive OR       |
| 0x0E   | PUSH     | CS        |           | Push CS segment onto stack |


## Compilation and Execution Process

1. **C Language**  
   - Written code in C.
   - **Compiles to** Assembly Language using:
     ```bash
     gcc -S -o foo.S foo.c
     ```

2. **Assembly Language**  
   - Low-level representation of code.
   - **Assembles into** Machine Code using:
     ```bash
     as -o foo.o foo.S
     ```

3. **Machine Code**  
   - Binary code that can be executed by the CPU.
   - **Linked to other machine code** to form an executable (Program Binary) using:
     ```bash
     ld -o foo foo.o bar.o baz.o
     ```

4. **Program Binary**  
   - The final executable file that can run on the CPU.
   - **Loaded into / runs on** the CPU using:
     ```bash
     ./foo
     ```

5. **CPU Execution**  
   - The CPU loads the program binary, starting with the instruction pointer at the first address.
   - Executes the instruction cycle: **Fetch → Decode → Execute → Write Back**, etc.

##### Note:
- `gcc` and `clang` can perform all these steps in one command:
  ```bash
  gcc -o foo foo.c bar.o baz.o
```


# Syscalls

### Using Asm
https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/

The value used for **%rdi**
- **1 (Standard Output)**:
    
    - This writes to the standard output stream (e.g., the terminal or console in most cases).
- **0 (Standard Input)**:
    
    - Though less common, you can write to standard input in certain contexts, such as when redirecting output from one process into another through pipes.
- **2 (Standard Error)**:
    
    - This writes to the standard error stream, often used for error messages. Using `2` as `%rdi` will send output to stderr, which is useful for separating regular output from error messages.

```asm
.code64

.section .rodata
msg:
    .ascii "Hello, World!\n"
    .set msglen, (. - msg)

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    mov $1, %rax       # this is the write syscall
    mov $1, %rdi       # we specify that this will go to stdout
    lea msg, %rsi      # loads msg to %rsi
    mov $msglen, %rdx  # takes length into %rdx
    syscall            # syscall

    mov $8, %rax
    mov $7, %rbx
    add %rax, %rbx     # simple adder result will end up in rbx

    mov $60, %rax      # this is the exit syscall
    mov %rbx, %rdi     # exit status
    syscall
```
The exit status can be accessed with ```echo $?``` after running the compiled executable

**Assemble** with `as` to create an object file:

```bash
as -o calc.o calc.S
```
    
This generates `calc.o`, an object file containing the machine code. **Link** with `ld` to produce an executable:
    
```bash
ld -o calc calc.o
```

If you’re using a custom entry point (e.g., `main` instead of `ld` default `_start`), specify it with:

```bash
ld -o calc calc.o -e main
```

### Using signals
```C
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        printf("need an argument\n);
        return 3;
    }

    int pid = atoi(argv[1];  //gets pid from arg and kills it
    kill(pid, 15); //here we send signal 15 which is SIGTERM
    return 0;
}
```

### Overwriting signals

```C
void sig_handler(int signum) {
   if (signum == SIGINT) {
        if (fork_id > 0) {
            kill(fork_id, SIGKILL); // terminating the child >:(
            fork_id = 0;
        } else {
            printf("\n"); // the terminal will start on a newline
            exit(0);
        }
        printf("\n"); // jump to new line when ^C out of
    }
}

int main() {
	signal(SIGINT, sig_handler)  //here i say that ^C signal will be sent to a the function sig_handler instead
}
```


# Program vs Process

**Program**: A sequence of instructions stored somewhere
**Process**: A running program



### Time Sharing
On the CPU, it can only run one process at a time, and this is where the OS uses *time sharing* to essentially switch between processes at some interval

How this is done?
- Context switch
- Policy: Scheduling

**A process context**
- Memory
- IC, instruction counter, %rip
- open files
- user-id
- process-id
- $\dots$
