**Lowering CPU overhead with Interrupts**
*Instead of polling the device repeatedly, the OS can issue a request, put the calling process to sleep, and context switch to another task.*

**Problem**:
- When a process requests I/O (e.g., reading from disk), the CPU can either:
    - **Poll**: Continuously check if the I/O operation is complete (wasting CPU time).
    - **Use Interrupts**: Allow the CPU to work on other tasks and handle the I/O completion only when notified by an interrupt.

**Solution with Interrupts**:
- **Interrupts** allow the CPU to handle other processes while waiting for I/O.
- When the I/O device completes the task, it sends an **interrupt** to the CPU, invoking an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** to handle the completion.
- This improves CPU utilization by overlapping I/O and computation, as shown in the second timeline, where the CPU handles **Process 2** during the I/O wait time instead of idling.

**Another Problem with Programmed I/O (PIO)**:
- When transferring data between memory and a device (like a disk) using **Programmed I/O (PIO)**, the CPU must handle the data transfer word by word.
- This is inefficient, as it burdens the CPU with low-level data movement, wasting time that could be used for other processes.

**Solution with DMA**:

- **DMA (Direct Memory Access)** offloads data transfer work from the CPU to a **DMA controller**.
- The CPU sets up the DMA transfer by telling the DMA controller:
    - **What data** to transfer.
    - **Where** to transfer it.
    - **How much** data to move.
- Once configured, the DMA controller takes over the transfer, allowing the CPU to work on other tasks in parallel.

+ The **DMA controller** moves the data directly from memory to the device (or vice versa), as shown by "c" blocks in the DMA timeline.

- works in tandem with the storage device drivers

# HDD
*each sector holds 4 KB*

Spindle: the motor
Platter: the disks where the info is stored
Track: rings of data strips on the platter
sector: the strips splitted up into 4 KB sectors
- used to be 512 B
- its an standard

**HDD is slow**
- seek time
	- the time the head needs to move to right track
- rotational latency
	- how much it can wait until right sector is under the head
- transfer time

### HDD internal cache
- the disk has cache for incoming writes
	- write-back cache
	- write-through
- this is why cutting of the HDD can cause memory loss
