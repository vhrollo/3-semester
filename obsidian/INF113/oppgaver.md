1. How does the assembly code differ between the optimization levels?
    
2. How do the instructions differ between **x86-64** and **ARM** for the same **C** code?
    
3. What is the purpose of assembly code that is not optimized?
    - readability
4. How does the compiler handle fixed variables and variable variables when running with higher optimization flags?
    - inlinecode?
5. How are conditional statements translated into assembly?
    - jump actions
6.  **(optional)** You must have noticed the repeated use of **rbp**, **rsp**, **edi**, **esi** and **eax**. What are they called? Find out their purpose and in which order they are used for the different operations. Why are they named with 3 letters? Interoperability?

1. **(optional)** In the assembly code, you may have noticed negative integers in front of **rbp**, what do they refer to?
