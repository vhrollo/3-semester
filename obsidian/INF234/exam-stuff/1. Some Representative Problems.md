$H = \{h_1, h_2, ... h_{len}\}$
$S = \{s_1, s_2, ... s_{len}\}$
$M \subset H\times S$ 


**Matching**
- M is a subset, where each S and H appear at most one time
- Perfect matching would be when $|M|= |H|=|S|$

**Preference** is a ranking of elements, an ordered list
- each h in H had to rank all S
- each s in S had to rank all H
- $s_3 >_h s_2 >_h s_1$

**Stable Matching**
- *input*
	- sets $H, S, |H|= |S|$
- *Output*
	- A stable perfect matching

**Unstable Pair**
- A pair where at least one of them has another partner which they prefer, and that partner would agree

**Valid Partner**
- A student $s\in S$ is a valid partner for $h\in H$ if there exists a stable matching $(h,s) \in M$

**Best valid Partner**
- The best valid partner for h, this will be unique
- best(h) = s, and v.v. 
## Gayle-Shapley Algorithm 
*an algorithm which take standpoint in one of the sets, and assigns the best person based on rankings*
```psudo
Initially all are free
While some h in H is unmatched and has not yet proposed to all students
	h proposes to the highest ranked student s that has not been proposed to
	if s is unmatched
		add (h,s) to M
	else if s prefers h over current matched h'
		replace (h', s) with (h, s) in M
	else
		s rejects h
```

```python
def stable_matching(hospitals_prefs, students_prefs):
    unmatched = list(hospitals_prefs)
    proposals = {h: iter(hospitals_prefs[h]) for h in hospitals_prefs} # iters remember where it last was, legit OP
    matches = {}

    while unmatched:
        h = unmatched.pop(0)
        try:
            s = next(proposals[h])
            if s not in matches:
                matches[s] = h
            else:
                h_prime = matches[s]
                if students_prefs[s].index(h) < students_prefs[s].index(h_prime):
                    matches[s] = h
                    unmatched.append(h_prime)
                else:
                    unmatched.append(h)
        except StopIteration:
            continue

    return [(h, s) for s, h in matches.items()]

# and then preferences in dicts
```

### Observations
**Observation 1**
- Hospitals propose in decreasing order of preference

**Observation 2**
- Students never gets unmatched
	- it will always get assigned, then switched if a better matching proposes

**Observation 3**
- If a hospital h is unmatched when G-S terminates, then h has proposed to all students
	- which also means that there is no more students left

### Lemmas
**Lemma 1**
- G-S terminates after at most $n^2$ iteration of the while loop
	- Let $P(t)$ be the number of pairs (h, s) that has proposed to s after iteration t
		- since one *unique proposal* is done every iteration, and there is total $n\times n$ if both H and S is n long
	- Note that P(t+1)> P(t)
		- it always proposes a *unique* proposal every iteration

**Lemma 2**
- G-S outputs a matching
	- No hospital can be in two pairs, as only free hospitals can give proposals
	- A student when proposed to, when free will be assigned, if not, it will be unmatched first
		- then the *dumped* hospital needs to find a new student

**Lemma 3**
- M is a perfect matching given that $|H| = |S|$
	- Suppose M is not a a perfect matching, something which would entail:
		- 1 free s and 1 free h
	- This makes an contradiction with **Obs 1** and **Obs 2**
		- h must have proposed to all
		- s cannot have been unmatched

**Lemma 4**
- M is stable, proofed by contradiction
	- Suppose that (h,s) is not in M, where they both prefer each other over their current matching:
		- h never proposed to s
			- this cannot be true, bc. of **Obs 1**, s has to have proposed before its current s'
		- h proposed to s, but got rejected
			- **Obs 2** says that it only switches if s prefers h over h' which it does, then it cannot get rejected and this is false
		- h was matched with s but later got unmatched
			- **Obs 2** follows here as well, but s prefers, h, then it would reject incoming proposals

**Lemma 5**
- The algorithm outputs the same stable matching
	- Suppose that there are two different orders of proposals leading to different stable matchings.
	- Contradiction: This would imply the existence of a more preferred stable matching for the proposers, contradicting the fact that the proposer-optimal stable matching is unique.

**Lemma 6**
- Every executable of G-S outputs M* (h, best(h))
- Every student gets their worst matching W* (worst(s), s)
- W* = M*
	- Proofed by contradiction; Suppose there exists an execution of the Gale-Shapley algorithm where at least one proposer does **not** get matched with their best valid partner.
		- Some execution *E* that outputs $(\hat{h}, \hat{s})$, where $\hat{s} \neq best(\hat{h})$, such that $\hat{h}$ does not have an best valid partner
		- Let *h* be the first proposer to be rejected by a valid partner *s* during the algorithm's execution.
			- At the moment *h* is rejected by *s*
			- *s* matched with some *h'* , which mean *h'* is preferred over *h*

		- Consider a Stable Matching Where *h* and *s* are Matched
			- Since *s* is a valid partner for *h*, there exists a stable matching *Mâ€²* where *h* is matched with *s*.
			 - *h'* proposed to s before *h* did
				 - this suggests that *h'* prefers s over any other, i.e. h' prefers s over s'
			- Therefore there arises an contradiction in *M'* and this cannot be the scenario

### Runtime
- This would then run  in $O(n^2)$, and $\Omega(n)$ if all accept immediately
