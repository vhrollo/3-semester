# Introduction to Tractability Limits

**Two-Pronged Approach**: When faced with new computational problems, the primary strategies are:
1. **Develop an Efficient Algorithm**: Attempt to find a polynomial-time solution.
2. **Prove NP-Completeness**: If an efficient algorithm isn't found, establish the problem's hardness by proving it's NP-complete.

# Beyond Exact Algorithm
- **Approximation Algorithms:** Provide near-optimal solutions with guaranteed error bounds in polynomial time.
- **Heuristics and Local Search:** Offer effective solutions without formal guarantees, useful in practical scenarios.

# Solving Problems on Trees
- **Tree Structures:** Many NP-complete problems become polynomial-time solvable when restricted to trees due to their hierarchical and acyclic nature.
**Independent Set** 
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Efficiently finds a maximum independent set by iteratively selecting leaf nodes.
- **Maximum-Weight Independent Set:** Uses dynamic programming to handle weighted nodes, ensuring optimal solutions by considering subtrees and their dependencies.

# Dynamic Programming on Trees

**Maximum-Weight Independent Set:**
- **Subproblem Definition:** For each node, define two scenarios:
    1. **Including the Node:** Add its weight and exclude its children.
    2. **Excluding the Node:** Consider the best solutions from its children.
- **Recursive Relations:**
    - **OPT_in(u):** Maximum weight including node u.
    - **OPT_out(u):** Maximum weight excluding node u.
- **Algorithm Steps:**
    1. **Post-Order Traversal:** Process children before parents to build solutions bottom-up.
    2. **Compute OPT_in and OPT_out:** Use the recursive formulas to determine optimal weights.
    3. **Reconstruct the Solution:** Trace back decisions to identify the actual independent set.


# When are problems in P
- **Vertex Cover on Trees**: Efficiently solvable using greedy or dynamic programming algorithms, placing this special case within P.
- **Independent Set on Trees:** Similarly, the tree structure allows for polynomial-time solutions.
