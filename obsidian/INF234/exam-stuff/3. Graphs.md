### Graph Representations

**Adjacency matrix**
- Space: $\Theta(n^2)$
- Search: $O(1)$
- Enum: $\Theta (n)$
	- Checking which neighbors a given *i* has
- Adding $O(1)$
- Remove vertex $\Theta (n^2)$
- Remove edge $O(1)$

**Adjacency List**
- Space: $\Theta (n + m)$
- search: $O(\min \text{(deg v, deg u)})$
	- Given size of deg v and deg u
- Enum $\Theta (deg(v))$
- Adding $O(deg(v))$
	- You need to check if it exists
- remove vertex $O (n+m)$
	- If vertex is fully connected, it needs to be removed from every list
- remove edge $O(deg(v)+deg(e))$
	- Remove index from only two lists

**Generally**
- If the graph is dense, the space taken would be roughly the same
- $\binom{n}{k}$ 
- For a graph to be **connected**, it means there is a **path** between every pair of vertices in the graph.
- A graph is **fully connected** (or **complete**) if there is an edge between every pair of vertices.
- **Strongly Connected (Directed Graphs):** A directed graph is strongly connected if, for every pair of vertices (u) and (v), there is a directed path from (u) to (v) and a directed path from (v) to (u). 
- A graph is **acyclic** if it contains no cycles.

- **Path:** A sequence of vertices connected by edges, where no vertex or edge is repeated.  
- **Undirected Path:** A path in an undirected graph where edges have no direction.  
- **Cycle:** A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no other repeated vertices or edges.  
- **Circuit:** A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated edges.  
- **Hamiltonian Circuit:** A circuit that visits every vertex in the graph exactly once.  
- **Eulerian Circuit:** A circuit that traverses every edge in the graph exactly once.  


**Trees**
- $G=(V, E)$ is a tree if G is connected and acyclic
- If $T = (V, E)$ is a tree we often consider it **rooted**, meaning one vertex $r \in V$ is designated as root, and is denoted it $(T,r)$
- A vertex $v \in V$ is a **leaf** if it has exactly one edge (degree 1).
    - Leaves represent endpoints of a tree's branches.

**Lemma**
- Any two imply the thirds:
	- *G* is connected
	- *G* is acyclic
	- *G* has $n-1$ edges

**Bipartite Graphs**
- A graph $B = (V, E)$ is a bipartite graph if V can be partioned into two sets; A and B, such that all edges have one endpoint in A and the other in B

**Quotient Graph**
- A graph whose vertices are blocks of a partition of vertices which are strongly connected
![[Pasted image 20240925100314.png]]
- Strongly connected component
	- A bulk of vertices which are strongly connected

# Coloring
- A proper k-coloring of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is an assignment of k colors from $X$, such that $uv \in E, X(u) \neq X(v)$
- 2-colorable
	- A graph is 2-colorable if it is possible to assign two colors to its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
	    - A graph is 2-colorable if and only if it has no odd-length cycles.
	    - Such graphs are also called bipartite graphs.
- 3-1-colorable
	- Let G be a 2-colorable graph, and let:
		- A be the set of vertices assigned one color.
		- B be the set of vertices assigned the other color.
	- To achieve 3-1-coloring:
		- Assign one color (e.g., color 1) to all vertices in A.
		- Assign a second color (e.g., color 2) to all vertices in B.
		- Use the third color (e.g., color 33) to color any additional vertex or group of vertices outside the current bipartition (if needed).

### **Theorem: Equivalent Conditions for a Graph \(G\)**
The following are equivalent (TFAE) for a graph \(G\):
1. \(G\) is **bipartite** (its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets \(A\) and \(B\) such that no two vertices in the same set are adjacent).
2. \(G\) is **2-colorable** (its vertices can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color).
3. \(G\) has **no odd-length cycles**.

### **Proofs**

#### **Proof 1: $1 \iff 2$**
- By definition, a graph $G$ is bipartite if and only if it is 2-colorable. The two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ in the bipartition correspond to the two colors.

---

#### **Proof 2: $1 \implies 3$**
- Assume $G$ is bipartite. By definition, all cycles in $G$ must alternate between the two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ of the bipartition.
- Consider a cycle $C = v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k, v_1$:
	- Without loss of generality (WLOG), let $v_1, v_3, v_5, \dots \in A$ and $v_2, v_4, v_6, \dots \in B$.
	- Since $v_1 = v_k$ and $C$ alternates between $A$ and $B$, the cycle length $|C| = k$ must be **even**.
- Therefore, $G$ has no odd cycles.

---

#### **Proof 3: $3 \implies 2$**
- Assume $G$ is a connected graph with no odd cycles. We claim $G$ is 2-colorable:
	  1. Choose an arbitrary vertex $r \in V$ as the root and assign it the color "red" ($x(r) = \text{red}$).
	  2. For any vertex $v \in V$, let $dist_G(r, v)$ (the distance from $r$ to $v$) determine its color:
     - Assign **red** if $dist_G(r, v)$ is even.
     - Assign **blue** if $dist_G(r, v)$ is odd.
		  1. **Claim**: This coloring $x$ is a proper 2-coloring.
     - Suppose $x$ is not a proper coloring. Then there exist adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ ($uv \in E$) such that $x(u) = x(v)$.
	     - By construction, $dist_G(r, u) \equiv dist_G(r, v) \pmod{2}$.
	     - Consider the cycle $C$ formed by:
		     - The shortest path from $r$ to $u$,
		     -  The edge $uv$,
		     - The shortest path from $v$ to $r$.
	     - The length of $C$ is:
		     - $1 + \text{even} + \text{even} = \text{odd}$, or
			- $1 + \text{odd} + \text{odd} = \text{odd}$.
     - This contradicts the assumption that $G$ has no odd cycles.
- Therefore, $x$ is a valid 2-coloring.

---

### **Corollary: Algorithm for Checking Bipartiteness**
- The above proof gives an algorithm for checking if a graph $G$ is bipartite:
	- Perform a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to determine distances from a root vertex $r$.
	- Assign colors based on the parity (even/odd) of the distances.
	- If any adjacent vertices share the same color, $G$ is not bipartite.

---

### **Additional Note**
- **3-Coloring Problem**:
  - Determining whether a graph is 3-colorable is **NP-complete**.
  - This means no polynomial-time algorithm is known for solving the problem in the general case.

# DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph 
*A very common structure in computer science, can be seen as a dependency network*
![[Pasted image 20241203135605.png]]
- Precedence Relations
-  topological ordering
	- $\forall (v_i, v_j) \in E \Rightarrow i < j$
- To check if G is a DAG
	- Can be done with BFS
```
To compute a topological ordering of G: 
	Find a node v with no incoming edges and order it first 
	Delete v from G Recursively compute a topological ordering of Gâˆ’{v} and append this order after v	
```



# Clique
*A set, C, is a clique of the graph G iff. $C\subseteq V(G)$ and $u,v\in C \land u \neq v \Rightarrow uv \in E(G)$*
