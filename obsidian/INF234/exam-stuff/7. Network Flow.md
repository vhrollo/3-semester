## Definitions

**Flow Network**
- A directed graph $G=(V,E)$
	- Capacities $c(u,v)\geq0$ for each edge $E(u,v)\in E$, which represent the maximum amount of flow allowed along that edge.
	- **Source** s and **sink** t, which are special vertices where flow originates and terminates, respectively.
		- Source has incoming $\infty$ and sink has outgoing $\infty$  

**Flow**
- A function $f : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies
	- **Capacity Constraint**: $0 \leq f(u,v) \leq c(u,v)$ for all $(u,v) \in E$
	- **Flow Conservation**: For all vertices $v \neq s$, t:
		- Everything flowing in has to flow out
$$
\sum_u f(u,v) = \sum_u f(v,u) 
$$

**Residual Graph**
- A derived graph $G_f$ used to represent remaining capacities and backflows for  adjustment
	- Foreward edges have capacity $c(u,v)-f(u,v)$ 
	- Backward edges have capacity $f(u,v)$

**Augmenting Paths**
- An **augmenting path** is a path from the source s to the sink t in the **residual graph** of a flow network, where every edge along the path has **positive residual capacity.** This means that additional flow can be pushed along this path to increase the total flow in the network. 

**s-t Cut**
- A partition of $V$ into two disjoint sets A and B such that $s \in A$ and $t \in B$
- The capacity of the cut is:
$$
cap(A,B)=\sum_{u\in A, v\in B}c(u,v)
$$
- A **minimum s-t cut** is a cut with the smallest possible capacity among all s-t cuts.

# The maximum-Flow Problem

**Problem**
- Find the maximum possible flow from the source $s$ to the sink $t$ in a flow network $G$
- It needs to be a flow, and within its constraints
	- Capacity constraint
	- Flow Conservation


## Ford-Fulkerson
*An algorithm to compute the maximum flow in a network*

- **Key Idea**: Repeatedly find augmenting paths in the residual graphs and adjust flow accordingly until no more augmenting paths exists.

#### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialization**:
    - Start with zero flow: $f(u,v)=0$ for all $(u, v) \in E$.
2. **While** there exists an **augmenting path** P from s to t in the residual graph $G_f$​:
    - **Determine the Bottleneck Capacity** b of P: 
$$
b = \min_{(u, v) \in P} c_f(u, v).
$$
    - **Augment the Flow** along P:
        - For each edge $(u,v)$ in P:
            - If $(u, v)$ is a forward edge in G: 
$$
f(u, v) \leftarrow f(u, v) + b.
$$
            - If $(u,v)$ is a backward edge in G (i.e., (v, u) in G): 
$$
f(v, u) \leftarrow f(v, u) - b.
$$
    - **Update the Residual Graph** $G_f$​ based on the new flow f.
3. **Termination**:
    - When no augmenting path exists in $G_f$, the current flow f is a **maximum flow**.

#### Properties and Observations
- **Flow Conservation Maintained**: At each iteration, the flow remains valid (satisfies capacity and conservation constraints).
- **Augmentation Increases Flow**: Each augmenting path increases the total flow from s to t by at least the bottleneck capacity $b > 0$.
- **Termination Guarantee**:
    - If capacities are integers, the Ford-Fulkerson method terminates after a finite number of iterations.
    - The maximum number of iterations is bounded by the total capacity from s to t.

# Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem

**Statement**
- The value of the **maximum flow** from s to t in a flow network is equal to the **capacity** of the minimum s-t cut.

**Implications**
- **Optimality of Flow**: A flow is maximum if and only if there is no augmenting path in the residual graph.
	- Augmenting paths are used to push more flow from s to t.
	- If no augmenting paths exist, the flow cannot be increased further, indicating that it is maximum.
- **Relationships Between Flows and Cuts**
	- **Flow Value Lemma:**
		- For any flow f and any s-t cut (A,B), the value of the flow v(f) is the net flow crossing the cut:
$$
v(f)= \sum_{u\in A, v\in B} f(u,v) - \sum_{u\in A, v\in B} f(v,u)$
$$
		- The first term measures flow from A to B.
		- The second term measures flow that "returns" from B to A.
	- **Weak Duality:**
		- For any flow f and any cut $(A,B)$:
			- $v(f) \leq cap(A,B)$
		- The flow value cannot exceed the capacity of any cut because flow is constrained by edge capacities.
			- All bottlenecks lined up
	- **Strong duality (Max-Flow Min-Cut Equivalence)**:
		- If a flow $f$ and cut $cut(A,B)$ satisfy:
$$
v(f)=\text{cap}(A,B)
$$
		- then:
			- f is a **maximal flow**
			- (A,B) is a **minimal cut**


**Proof**
- **Weak Duality**
	- For any flow $f$ and any s-t $\text{cut}(A,B)$, the total flow across the cut is limited by the capacity of the cut:
$$
v(f)\leq \text{cap}(A,B)
$$
	- This holds because:
		- he flow on any edge cannot exceed the edge's capacity (capacity constraint).
		- Summing over all edges in the cut yields $v(f) \leq \text{cap}(A, B)$
- **Termination Condition**
	- When no more augmenting paths exist in the residual graph $G_f$, the current flow $f$ is maximum
	- The residual graph $G_f$​ defines a partition $(A, B)$:
	    - A: The set of vertices reachable from s in $G_f$​.
	    - B: The rest of the vertices.
	- Edges from A to B in the original graph G form a cut.
- **Flow Equals Cut Capacity**
	- In the residual graph $G_f$, all edges from A to B are saturated (residual capacity = 0), and all edges from B to A have no flow.
	- Therefore, the flow across the cut equals the total capacity of the cut:
$$
	v(f)=\text{cap}(A,B)
$$

# Solving Bipartite matching using maximum-flow

**Problem**
- A **bipartite graph** $G=(V,E)$ is an undirected graph where node set can be divided into two disjoint sets $X$ and $Y$ such that every edge $(u,v)$ has one endpoint in X and the other in Y.
- A **matching** M in G is a subset of edges $M \subseteq E$ such that no two edges in M share a common endpoint. The **Bipartite Matching Problem** involves finding a matching M of the **largest possible size** in G

**Approach**
*To solve the Bipartite Matching Problem using **network flow**, we can reduce the problem to a **Maximum Flow Problem**:*

1. **Transforming the Graph**:
    - Direct all edges in G from X to Y.
    - Add a **source node** s and connect it to every node in X with edges of capacity 1.
    - Add a **sink node** t and connect every node in Y to t with edges of capacity 1.
    - Assign a capacity of 1 to all edges in the transformed graph G′.
- **Computing Maximum Flow**:
    - Apply the **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm** or any maximum flow algorithm on G′.
    - The value of the maximum flow will be equal to the size of the maximum matching in G.
- **Recovering the Matching**:
    - In the maximum flow solution, extract edges $(x, y) \in G'$ (where $x \in X, y \in Y$) with flow $f(x, y) = 1$.
    - These edges form the **maximum matching** M in the original graph G.


#### Flow Encoding Matchings

1. **From Matching to Flow**:
    
    - If M is a matching of size k, create a flow f in G′ by sending one unit of flow along the path $s \to x \to y \to t$ for each $(x, y) \in M$.
    - The flow value $v(f) = k$.
2. **From Flow to Matching**:
    - If f is a maximum flow of value k in G′, then there are k edges $(x, y) \in G$ with $f(x, y) = 1$, and these edges form a matching in G.

#### Key Facts
1. The flow value equals the size of the matching.
2. Each node in X is connected to at most one node in Y because of the capacity constraints.


#### Complexity
- The algorithm runs in $O(mn)$ time, making it highly efficient for practical use cases.
