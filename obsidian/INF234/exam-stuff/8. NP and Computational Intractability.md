# Definitions
*P vs NP*

**Def. (Polynomial time)**
- **P** is the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time. I.e. there exists an algorithm and a constant c that this algorithm solves the problem in time $O(n^c)$ where the input n is the size of the input. *This has to be done on a deterministic Turing machine*

**Def. (Non-deterministic Polynomial time)** - general def.
- **NP** is the class of problem that can be solved in polynomial time on a non-deterministic Turing Machine.

**Def. (NP)** - more relevant for us
- **NP** is the class of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time
	- the you should have all info to verify in polynomial time
	- given as a decision problem  $\rightarrow$ yes/no

# Polynomial-Time Reductions ($\leq P$)
*To compare the relative difficulty of problems by showing that solving one problem efficiently would allow solving another efficiently.*

**Definition**:
- $Y\leq_p X$: Problem Y is polynomial-time reducible to Problem X. This means that if a polynomial-time algorithm exists for X, then a polynomial-time algorithm can be constructed for Y using X as a subroutine (black box).
**Implications**
- If $Y\leq_p X$ and $X\in P$, then $Y \in P$
- Y is more powerful, since Y can solve X
- This means that X is easier than Y
