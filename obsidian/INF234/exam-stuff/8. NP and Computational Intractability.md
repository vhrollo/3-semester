# Definitions
*P vs NP*

**Def. (Polynomial time)**
- **P** is the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time. I.e. there exists an algorithm and a constant c that this algorithm solves the problem in time $O(n^c)$ where the input n is the size of the input. *This has to be done on a deterministic Turing machine*

**Def. (Non-deterministic Polynomial time)** - general def.
- **NP** is the class of problem that can be solved in polynomial time on a non-deterministic Turing Machine.

**Def. (NP)** - more relevant for us
- **NP** is the class of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time
	- the you should have all info to verify in polynomial time
	- given as a decision problem  $\rightarrow$ yes/no


**Examples of NP-Complete problems**
- Independent Set
- Vertex Cover
- Clique
- Satisfiability (SAT)
- 3-Coloring
- Dominating Set
- Knapsack (Weak NP-Complete)

**Weak NP-Complete Problems**
- These problems are **NP-complete** but have pseudo-polynomial time algorithms (algorithms whose running time is polynomial in the numeric value of the input, not the input size).
- **Examples:**
    - **Knapsack**
    - **Subset Sum**

# Decision Problems
- **Definition:** A **decision problem** is a problem with a binary output: **Yes** or **No**.
	- **Formal Representation:**
		- **Problem** $\Pi$: A set of strings $\Pi \subseteq \Sigma^*$, where $\Sigma^*$ is the set of all finite strings over some alphabet $\Sigma$.
	- **Instance:** A string $s \in \Sigma^*$.
	- **Algorithm A for $\Pi$:** A procedure that, given s, outputs: 
$$
A(s) = \begin{cases} \text{Yes}, & \text{if } s \in \Pi \\ \text{No}, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
​$$

# Certifiers and Verification

**Certifier:**
- **Definition:** An algorithm C that verifies whether a given solution t is valid for an instance s.
- **Formally:** $C(s, t) = \text{Yes}$ if t is a valid solution for s, and **No** otherwise.
- **Certificate (Witness):** The solution t provided to the certifier.

# Polynomial-Time Reductions ($\leq P$)
*To compare the relative difficulty of problems by showing that solving one problem efficiently would allow solving another efficiently.*

**Definition**:
- $Y\leq_p X$: Problem Y is polynomial-time reducible to Problem X. This means that if a polynomial-time algorithm exists for X, then a polynomial-time algorithm can be constructed for Y using X as a subroutine (black box).
**Implications**
- If $Y\leq_p X$ and $X\in P$, then $Y \in P$
- Y is more powerful, since Y can solve X
- This means that X is easier than Y

### **Definitions of Key NP-Complete Problems**

Below are concise definitions for several fundamental NP-Complete problems:


#### **1. Independent Set**

- **Definition:**
    - **Input:** A graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer k.
    - **Question:** Does G contain an independent set of size at least k?
- **Independent Set:** A subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that no two vertices in S are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between any pair of vertices in S).



#### **2. Vertex Cover**

- **Definition:**
    - **Input:** A graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer k.
    - **Question:** Does G contain a vertex cover of size at most k?
- **Vertex Cover:** A subset of vertices $C \subseteq V$ such that every edge in E is incident to at least one vertex in C.


#### **3. Clique**

- **Definition:**
    - **Input:** A graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer k.
    - **Question:** Does G contain a clique of size at least k?
- **Clique:** A subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ where every pair of vertices in S is connected by an edge (i.e., S forms a complete subgraph).


#### **4. Satisfiability (SAT)**

- **Definition:**
    - **Input:** A boolean formula $\Phi$ in conjunctive normal form (CNF).
    - **Question:** Is there an assignment of truth values to the variables in $\Phi$ that makes the entire formula true?
- **Satisfiability (SAT):** The problem of determining whether a given CNF boolean formula can be satisfied by some assignment of true ($\top$) and false ($\bot$) values to its variables.


#### **5. 3-Coloring**

- **Definition:**
    - **Input:** A graph $G = (V, E)$ and three distinct colors.
    - **Question:** Can the vertices of G be colored using only these three colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color?
- **3-Coloring:** The problem of assigning one of three colors to each vertex of a graph so that adjacent vertices receive different colors.



#### **6. Dominating Set**

- **Definition:**
    - **Input:** A graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer k.
    - **Question:** Does G contain a dominating set of size at most k?
- **Dominating Set:** A subset of vertices $D \subseteq V$ such that every vertex not in D is adjacent to at least one vertex in D.


#### **7. Set Cover**

- **Definition**:
	- A universe $U=\{e_1​,e_2​,\dots,e_n\}$ of elements.
	- A collection of subsets $S=\{S_1,S_2,\dots,S_m\}$ where each $S_i \subseteq u$.
	- An integer k.
**Question**
- Is there a collection of at most k subsets in $\mathcal{S}$ whose union equals the entire universe $\mathcal{U}$?
**Set Cover**
- A selection of subsets $C\subseteq S$ with $|C|\subseteq k$ such that every element in U is contained in at least one subset in C.

# Lemma. $I.S \equiv_p V.C$
*Independent Set and vertex Cover*

*do |V| - k = k', and solve with k' for the other*
### $I.S \leq_p V.C$
- **Given:** An instance of Independent Set, $(G, k)$, where $G=(V,E)$ is a graph and k is the size of the desired independent set.
- **Transform to:** An instance of Vertex Cover, $(G, k' = |V| - k)$.

**Logic**:
- **Observation:** A set $S \subseteq V$ is an independent set of size k in G **if and only if** its complement $C = V - S$ is a vertex cover of size $|V| - k$.
- **Therefore:** Solving the Vertex Cover instance $(G, k')$ will answer the Independent Set instance $(G, k)$.

**Procedure**:
- Use the Vertex Cover oracle to determine if G has a vertex cover of size $k^′=∣V∣−k$.
- If yes: Then G has an independent set of size k.
- If no: Then G does not have an independent set of size k.

**Logic**:
- **Observation:** A set $C \subseteq V$ is a vertex cover of size k in G **if and only if** its complement $S = V - C$ is an independent set of size $|V| - k$.
- **Therefore:** Solving the Independent Set instance $(G, k')$ will answer the Vertex Cover instance $(G, k)$.

**Procedure**
- Use the Independent Set oracle to determine if G has an independent set of size $k' = |V| - k$.
- **If yes:** Then G has a vertex cover of size k.

# Lemma. $\text{Clique}\equiv_p I.S$
*Independent Set and Clique*

*Complement G and solve for the other*

 **Complement Graph**:
- **Vertices:** Same as G, V.
- **Edges:** (u, v) is an edge in $\overline{G}$ **if and only if** $(u, v)$ is **not** an edge in G.

## $I.S\leq_p \text{Clique}$
- **Given:** An instance of Independent Set, $(G, k)$, where $G = (V, E)$ is a graph and k is the size of the desired independent set.
- **Transform to:** An instance of Clique, $(\overline{G}, k)$, where $\overline{G}$ is the **complement graph** of G.

**Logic**:
- **Observation:** A set $S \subseteq V$ is an independent set in G **if and only if** S forms a clique in $\overline{G}$.
- **Therefore:** Solving the Clique instance $(\overline{G}, k)$ will answer the Independent Set instance (G, k).

**Procedure:**
- Construct $\overline{G}$ by adding all non-existent edges from G and removing existing edges.
- Use the Clique oracle to determine if $\overline{G}$ has a clique of size k.
- **If yes:** Then G has an independent set of size k.
- **If no:** Then G does not have an independent set of size k.
## $\text{Clique}\leq_p I.S$

- **Given:** An instance of Clique, $(G, k)$, where $G = (V, E)$ is a graph and k is the size of the desired clique.
- **Transform to:** An instance of Independent Set, $(\overline{G}, k)$, where $\overline{G}$ is the **complement graph** of G.

**Logic:**
- **Observation:** A set $S \subseteq V$ is a clique in G **if and only if** S forms an independent set in $\overline{G}$.
- **Therefore:** Solving the Independent Set instance $(\overline{G}, k)$ will answer the Clique instance $(G, k)$.

**Procedure:**
- Construct $\overline{G}$ by adding all non-existent edges from G and removing existing edges.
- Use the Independent Set oracle to determine if $\overline{G}$ has an independent set of size k.
- **If yes:** Then G has a clique of size k.
- **If no:** Then G does not have a clique of size k.

# Lemma. $V.C \leq_p S.C$
*Set Cover and vertex Cover*

**Given**:
- $G=(V,E)$ is a graph.
- k is the maximum number of vertices allowed in the vertex cover

**Transform**:
- An instance of Set Cover, $(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{S}, k)$, where:
	- **Universe $\mathcal{U}$:** Set of all edges in G, i.e., $\mathcal{U} = E(G)$.
	- **Collection of Subsets $\mathcal{S}$:** For each vertex $v \in V$, define a subset $S_v \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ consisting of all edges incident to v. Formally, 
$$S_v = \{ e \in E(G) \mid e \text{ is incident to } v \}$$
- **Parameter k:** Remains the same as in the Vertex Cover instance.

**Vertex Cover Correspondence:**
- A **vertex cover** of size k in G corresponds to a **set cover** of size k in $\mathcal{S}$.
- **Reasoning:**
    - Selecting a vertex v in the vertex cover covers all edges incident to v.
    - Therefore, selecting k vertices to cover all edges is equivalent to selecting k subsets whose union covers the entire universe $\mathcal{U}$

**Using set Coracle**
- Invoke the Set Cover oracle (a hypothetical black-box algorithm that solves Set Cover instances) with the constructed instance $(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{S}, k)$.
- **If the oracle returns "Yes":**
    - There exists a set cover $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ with $|\mathcal{C}| \leq k$.
    - The corresponding vertices in $\mathcal{C}$ form a vertex cover in G.
- **If the oracle returns "No":**
    - No such set cover exists, implying that no vertex cover of size k exists in G.
