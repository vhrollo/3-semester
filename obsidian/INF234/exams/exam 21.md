# More Big O

$O(n\log_2 n)$
$O(n\log_{32} n)$

These two will be a constant from each other, this means that

$n\log_2 n \cdot c = n\log_{32} n$

This can be proved 


# True or False

4. no, the longer paths will be punished for being longer
5. **Layered Exploration:** BFS explores the graph in layers based on the distance from the source vertex sss. It first explores all vertices at distance 1, then all vertices at distance 2, and so on.
6. It is used for finding the optimal path in non negative weighted graphs, but it also works in a non weighted graph, as each edge can be represented as 1
7. Since it's the final residual graph, the algorithm has finished. This mean that there will be no more augmenting paths.
8. yes.
9. no

22. yes
23. yes
24. no
25. yes
26. yes
27. 2 edges cant create a cycle, and since all edges are unique, both Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's
28. nie
29. no, but techically yes
30. no
31. yes

35. no, or if m =n in the case of O(n+m) where m < n
