# 1

-  This statement is false, and an valid counterexample showing this is a set of two men and two women.
	- m prefers w over w'
	- m' prefers w' over w
	- w prefers m' over m
	- w' prefers m over m'

# 2
- Given that man m and woman w who rank each other as their top choice the G-S, the woman w that m is going to propose to first will be the highest ranked one, and if woman w is paired with man m', then she will compare m' to m. Every m' will be switched out when compared to m, and therefore this statement is true. Every stable matching S will include (m, w).

# 5a 
- Given that the women feel indifferent about their ties, we could just break them up. We know that G-S algorithm always give a stable matching their preferences doesn't have ties. How we break them up, could be randomly, by their index in the list, or some other way. 
  With the list now properly ordered we run the G-S algorithm, and we get an stable matching knowing how it works. To then add, the answer is yes.
# 5b
- No it does not always exist a perfect matching with no weak instability, an example of an perfect matching which includes a weak instability is this one:
	- w prefers m over m'
	- w'prefers m over m'
	- m is indifferent about w and w'
	- m' prefers w over w' ( this one doesn't really matter, it could also be indifferent or switched)
- if we pair m' with w, and m with w', and we see that an instability occur however m' prefers, and however we choose to pair them.
