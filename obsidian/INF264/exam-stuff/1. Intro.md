# What is machine learning?
*Field of study that vies computes the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed* - Arthur Samuel

*A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance in tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.* - Mitchell

Concepts
- Task
- Performance measure
- Experience

# Supervised learning
- Task: predict labels of new, unseen objects
- Performance measure: e.g., prediction accuracy
- Experience: object-label pair

# Unsupervised learning
- Learn a hidden structure from unlabeled
- Typical tasks:
	- clustering
	- dimensionality reduction

# Reinforcement learning
- An agent tries to maximize a reward by taking actions in an environment
- No objects/label pairs, only feedback from the actions
