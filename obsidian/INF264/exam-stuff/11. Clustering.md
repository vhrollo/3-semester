*Used to find intrinsic structure in unlabeled data. Cluster is a set items so that items are similar within a cluster and dissimilar between clusters*

## Types of clusters

**Centroid models**: a cluster is represented by a single mean vector
**Distribution models**: clusters are modeled with statistical distributions
**Connectivity models**: build clusters based on distance connectivity
**Density models**: a cluster is a set of points connected by dense regions
**Gaussian models** a cluster is a Gaussian model which predict how likely a point is to be in that cluster



## K-means
- Represented by a centroid
- We assume that there is exactly k *clusters*
- **Within-cluster variance for cluster \( j \)**:
  $$ \text{Var}[D_j] = \frac{1}{|D_j|} \sum_{x_i \in D_j} \| x_i - \mu_j \|^2, $$
  where $( \mu_j )$ is the mean vector of the points belonging to cluster $( j )$.

- **Weighted within-cluster variance** (by cluster size):
  $$ |D_j| \, \text{Var}[D_j] = \sum_{x_i \in D_j} \| x_i - \mu_j \|^2. $$
