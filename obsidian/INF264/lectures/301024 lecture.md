### Sources of bias


### Ensamble
- boosting
	- reduced variance, where you weight the difficult higher 
- bootstrap aggregation
	- taking 67% of the data in the ensemble to prevent bias


### Linear models
- linear regression
	- derivate it
- Bayesian regression
	- guess the probability of the parameters

### Dealing with non-linearity
- Data transforms - feature extraction 
	- RBFs
	- SVMs
		- maximum margin linear
		- trying to find the biggest no man land
		- transform based on inner product
	- Neural Networks
		- MLP
		- recurrent
		- convolutional
			- blindly will recognize the feature
			- will find things regardless of position

### Unsupervised methods
- Clustering(k-means, hierarchial, EM)
- autoencoders
- dimentionality reduction
	- linear autoencoder
